    <h2>Acceptance of Terms</h2>
    <p>By downloading, installing, or using PanicVault ("the App"), you agree to be bound by these Terms of Service. If you do not agree to these terms, do not use the App.</p>

    <h2>Description of Service</h2>
    <p>PanicVault is a password manager that stores your credentials in encrypted KeePass (.kdbx) files on your device. The App can optionally sync vault files through iCloud Drive or Google Drive using your own accounts. PanicVault does not operate servers or cloud infrastructure.</p>

    <h2>Your Responsibilities</h2>
    <p>As a user of PanicVault, you acknowledge and agree that:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Master password:</strong> You are solely responsible for creating and remembering your master password. We cannot recover, reset, or retrieve your master password under any circumstances. If you lose your master password, your vault data cannot be accessed.</li>
      <li><strong>Backups:</strong> You are responsible for maintaining backups of your vault file. We recommend keeping copies in multiple locations.</li>
      <li><strong>Device security:</strong> You are responsible for the security of your devices and the cloud storage accounts used for sync.</li>
      <li><strong>Lawful use:</strong> You agree to use the App only for lawful purposes and in compliance with applicable laws.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Intellectual Property</h2>
    <p>PanicVault and its original content, features, and functionality are owned by Pierre Stanislas and are protected by applicable copyright, trademark, and other intellectual property laws. The KeePass file format is an open standard; KeePass is a trademark of Dominik Reichl. PanicVault is not affiliated with or endorsed by the KeePass project.</p>

    <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>If you use iCloud Drive or Google Drive to sync your vault, your use of those services is governed by Apple's and Google's respective terms of service and privacy policies. PanicVault is not responsible for the availability, security, or operation of those services.</p>

    <h2>No Warranty</h2>
    <p>PanicVault is provided on an "as is" and "as available" basis, without warranties of any kind, either express or implied. We do not warrant that:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The App will be uninterrupted, error-free, or free of harmful components</li>
      <li>The App will meet your specific requirements</li>
      <li>Any data stored through the App will be preserved indefinitely</li>
      <li>Defects in the App will be corrected in a specific timeframe</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Limitation of Liability</h2>
    <p>To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, Pierre Stanislas shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages, including but not limited to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Loss of data or access to your accounts</li>
      <li>Loss of profits or revenue</li>
      <li>Unauthorized access to your vault resulting from device compromise</li>
      <li>Any damages arising from your failure to maintain your master password or backups</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Indemnification</h2>
    <p>You agree to indemnify and hold harmless Pierre Stanislas from any claims, damages, losses, or expenses (including legal fees) arising from your use of the App or your violation of these terms.</p>

    <h2>Termination</h2>
    <p>You may stop using PanicVault at any time. Since the App stores data locally in an open format, your data remains accessible through any KeePass-compatible application even if you stop using PanicVault.</p>

    <h2>Changes to These Terms</h2>
    <p>We reserve the right to modify these terms at any time. Updated terms will be posted on this page with a new effective date. Continued use of PanicVault after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated terms.</p>

    <h2>Contact</h2>
